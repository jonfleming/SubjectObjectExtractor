The top executives of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson said in an NBC News interview that even after their companies developed potential Covid-19 vaccines at a breakneck pace, some of their biggest challenges still lie ahead, including quickly producing enough doses and ensuring fair distribution through the uneven U.S. health care system.

"We have never done anything like this," Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said, speaking of the logistics of reaching billions of people with potential vaccines.

The executives — Gorsky, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Moderna President Stephen Hoge — spoke in an exclusive joint interview with NBC News' Lester Holt. The interview is scheduled to air Thursday on "Dateline NBC" at 10 p.m. ET.
