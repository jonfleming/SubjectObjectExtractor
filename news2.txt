On Jan. 20, President-elect Joe Biden will move into the White House — and that means President Trump is 
going to have to find somewhere else to live. Since he changed his legal address from Trump Tower in New York 
City to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., some have assumed that’s where he’ll go after leaving 
Washington.

He’s voted from that address in the most recent Florida primary and general election. Construction work and 
renovations are reportedly being done to expand the living quarters. And ABC News reported last week that 
members of his Secret Service detail have been asked if they’d like to relocate to the area.

There’s just one problem: Per an agreement with the town of Palm Beach, no one is actually allowed to live at 
Mar-a-Lago full time. Not even Donald Trump.

Trump first purchased the 126-room, 62,500-square-foot mansion and 17.5-acre estate as a home for $10 million 
in 1985. But when he found himself in some financial trouble in the early ’90s, Trump sought to divide the 
land into smaller properties.
